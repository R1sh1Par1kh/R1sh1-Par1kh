👋 Hi I'm Rishi Parikh!

I am a middle school student, age 13, and am starting to learn the coding language, Python!

Did you know…?
🎙 I cohost a podcast and this is [the itunes link](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tech-hour/id1545801253).
🌮 I LOVE mexican food - especially quesadillas.
🏊‍♂️ Swimming is my favorite extracurricular activity - along with coding, of course.
✈️ Though I am a little scared of flight, going on vacation helps me relax and reunite with distant family.
🍿 Watching movies and binging TV shows are on the list of things to do when I'm bored.
📷 I'm not a professional, but I know how to take good [pictures](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ljE0o4Fhn_gs3btaJMnCku8iSwcROJab/view?usp=drivesdk)
